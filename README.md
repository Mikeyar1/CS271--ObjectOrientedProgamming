# Flexible Dice Game

This project implements a simple, text-based dice game in Java, showcasing object-oriented programming concepts through the creation and manipulation of dice and dice towers. It's designed as a lab exercise for CSE 271, focusing on class structures, inheritance, and basic game logic.

## Overview

The game involves two main classes, `Die` and `DiceTower`, and a driver class `Game` that simulates a dice game between two players. Players roll their sets of dice through a dice tower, and the one with the highest total wins each round. The game runs for three rounds to determine the overall winner.

### Features

- Creation of customizable dice with flexible sides and values.
- Management of dice collections through a "Dice Tower".
- Simulated gameplay between two players with variable dice configurations.
