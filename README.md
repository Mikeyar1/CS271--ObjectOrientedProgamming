# CS271--ObjectOrientedProgamming
Object-oriented programming projects for my CS271 class at Miami University.

Card Game project! This Java-based card game is a variation of Go Fish where players aim to collect sets of four cards of the same rank, also known as a book. The game supports 2 to 4 players, each dealt seven cards at the beginning.

How to Play
Each player takes turns asking another player for a specific rank of card.
If the queried player has the requested card, they must relinquish all cards of that rank to the asking player.
If the queried player doesn't have the card, the asking player must "Go Fish" and draw a card from the deck.
When a player collects four cards of the same rank, a book is formed, removed from the hand, and the player's score is updated.

Objective
Players strive to create as many books as possible, with each book contributing to their score. The game concludes when all books have been gathered, and there are no cards left.
